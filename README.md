Description:

</h2>
<p align="center">

Often I have to stop off at the shops to pick up a few items for my family and pets at home, however there is alomst always something that I am not told to get untill I get back home, which results in me having to make multiple trips to the shops in one day, which is a huge problem for me, threrefore my soultuion to this problem is this shopping list app, it is centeralised so everyone who has the app can view one shopping list, which they are also able to edit->(add & remove items) the shopping list, thus resulting in no miss communication and me not having to make multiple trips to the shop in one day, I also decided to develop this app as a [PWA](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+PWA) so I would not have to worry about all the different devices that my family members have, as PWA's can be used on just about any device, I also built this app using [Pyscript](https://pyscript.net/) because I like to challenge myself and learn new things all the time. Everyone builds PWA's using [Javascript](https://github.com/AranMesquita/ProblemSolving/tree/main/Javascript) as that is the main language of the WEB, however I am not like everyone else, because **I can do anything**, as I am a **Problem Solver**, so I chose to build this Shopping List app using PyScript, to see just how easy [Python](https://github.com/AranMesquita/ProblemSolving/tree/main/Python) could be implemented on the WEB.
